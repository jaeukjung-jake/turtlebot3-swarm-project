# TurtleBot3 Swarm Navigation Project

This repository documents the full process of building a multi-robot TurtleBot3 swarm system using Raspberry Pi 4 and ROS 2.

The ultimate goal of this project is to achieve **autonomous swarm navigation**, where multiple TurtleBot3 units (RED, GREEN, BLUE) coordinate and communicate with each other in real-time.
